   <p> it is a legendary meme its best meme for me </p> 
   <p>The practice of rickrolling started in 2007 on the image board 4chan. The first-ever rickroll involved a link promising to be a trailer for the game “Grand Theft Auto IV,” that instead directed excited gamers to the “Never Gonna Give You Up” music video.

The rick part of rickrolling comes from Astley’s first name, but where does the roll part come from? It turns out that also started on 4chan, according to Know Your Meme. In the mid-2000s, the then-director of the site, who is known as “moot,” decided to prank users by changing all instances of the word egg to duck. This, of course, changed the word eggroll to duckroll, which created such an amusing mental image that someone photoshopped wheels onto a picture of a duck. Suddenly 4chan users were posting bait-and-switch links that led people to a wheeled-duck image. The practice soon took on the name duckrolling.

Since 2007, rickrolling has taken on a life of its own. In 2008, Astley contributed to a live-action rickroll during the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade when he emerged from inside a Cartoon Network float to sing his famous song. By 2011, rickrolling had become so mainstream that the White House’s official Twitter handle sent users to the video of “Never Gonna Give You Up” after a user complained that the correspondence briefing from that day wasn’t as entertaining as the one from the day before.</p>
